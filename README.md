# Groceries List Progressive Web App with Firebase
 'To-be-named' PWA helps users keep track the groceries they need in a single list and allows them to 'check off' grocery items as they buy them in realtime. For this project I'm using the Vanilla Frontend Stack of HTML, CSS, & JS and using Firebase Real Time Database to store user data. The design implementation is primarily meant for use as a PWA on mobile, but can also work as a regular Web App in any Browser.

 This project is based off my Scrimba Frontend Development Bootcamp, 'Build a Mobile App with JS' project.
 
 To expand on this project I'm currently working on: 

 * Updating the overall branding, style, & visual design

 * Adding user authentication with Firebase Auth

 * Improving the UX of adding, removing, and keeping track of items you've purchased in real time

 * Planning for an initial round of user testing & feedback gathering to learn about the App experience
